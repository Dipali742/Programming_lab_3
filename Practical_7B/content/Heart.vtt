00:02:56.116 --> 00:03:00.215
Every night in my dreams

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.118
I see you I feel you

00:03:05.308 --> 00:03:13.307
That is how I know you go on

00:03:15.015 --> 00:03:19.014
Far across the distance

00:03:19.202 --> 00:03:24.501
And spaces between us

00:03:24.701 --> 00:03:32.700
You have come to show you go on

00:03:34.404 --> 00:03:42.403
Near far wherever you are

00:03:43.003 --> 00:03:51.002
I believe that the heart does go on

00:03:53.714 --> 00:04:01.713
Once more you open the door

00:04:02.107 --> 00:04:10.106
And You are here in my heart and
my heart will go on and on

00:04:22.818 --> 00:04:27.217
Love can touch us one time

00:04:27.413 --> 00:04:32.212
And last for a lifetime

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:40.399
And never let go till We are gone

00:04:42.109 --> 00:04:46.308
Love was when I loved you

00:04:46.514 --> 00:04:51.713
One true time I hold you

00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:59.900
In my life we′ll always go on

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:09.709
Near far wherever you are

00:05:10.107 --> 00:05:18.106
I believe that the heart does go on

00:05:21.002 --> 00:05:29.001
Once more you open the door

00:05:29.617 --> 00:05:33.616
And You are here in my heart

00:05:33.804 --> 00:05:41.803
And my heart will go on and on

00:05:59.913 --> 00:06:07.912
You are here there′s nothing I fear

00:06:08.406 --> 00:06:16.405
And I know that my heart will go on

00:06:19.205 --> 00:06:27.204
We′ll stay forever this way

00:06:27.614 --> 00:06:32.613
You are safe in my heart and
my heart will go on and on
