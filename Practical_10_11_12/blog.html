                <h1>Machine Learning</h1>

		<section style="margin-left:17%;margin-right:17%;" class="text-format"><p>Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence based on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.</p>

		<h2 class="text-format1">Evolution of machine learning
		</h2>
		<section style="margin-left:13%;margin-right:13%;" class="text-format">
		Because of new computing technologies, machine learning today is not like machine learning of the past. It was born from pattern recognition and the theory that computers can learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks; researchers interested in artificial intelligence wanted to see if computers could learn from data. The iterative aspect of machine learning is important because as models are exposed to new data, they are able to independently adapt. They learn from previous computations to produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results. It’s a science that’s not new – but one that has gained fresh momentum.

		<h2 class="text-format1">Types of machine learning</h2>
		<section style="margin-left:13%;margin-right:13%;" class="text-format">Classical machine learning is often categorized by how an algorithm learns to become more accurate in its predictions. There are four basic approaches: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. The type of algorithm a data scientist chooses to use depends on what type of data they want to predict.

		<h2 class="text-format1">How it works?
		</h2>
		<section style="margin-left:13%;margin-right:13%;" class="text-format">
		To get the most value from machine learning, you have to know how to pair the best algorithms with the right tools and processes. SAS combines rich, sophisticated heritage in statistics and data mining with new architectural advances to ensure your models run as fast as possible – even in huge enterprise environments.

		<h2 class="text-format1">Why is machine learning important? 
		</h2>
		<section style="margin-left:13%;margin-right:13%;" class="text-format">
		Resurging interest in machine learning is due to the same factors that have made data mining and Bayesian analysis more popular than ever. Things like growing volumes and varieties of available data, computational processing that is cheaper and more powerful, and affordable data storage.


		</section>
		<section style="margin-left:13%;margin-right:13%;" class="text-format">All of these things mean it's possible to quickly and automatically produce models that can analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver faster, more accurate results – even on a very large scale. And by building precise models, an organization has a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities – or avoiding unknown risks.</section>
		
		<h2 class="text-format1"> Which software libraries are available for ML?  
		</h2>
		<section style="margin-left:13%;margin-right:13%;" class="text-format">There are a wide variety of software frameworks for getting started with training and running machine-learning models, typically for the programming languages Python, R, C++, Java and MATLAB.</section>
		<section style="margin-left:13%;margin-right:13%;" class="text-format">Famous examples include Google's TensorFlow, the open-source library Keras, the Python library Scikit-learn, the deep-learning framework CAFFE and the machine-learning library Torch.</section>
