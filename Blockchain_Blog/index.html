        <h2>What is Blockchain Technology?</h2>
        <strong>A blockchain, originally block chain, is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).<br>
        If this technology is so complex, why call it “blockchain?” At its most basic level, 
        blockchain is literally just a chain of blocks, but not in the traditional sense of those words.
         When we say the words “block” and “chain” in this context, we are actually talking about digital information (the “block”) stored in a public database (the “chain”).</strong><br><br>

			<h2>1. How To Secure Your Blockchain Smart Contracts (by Nishi Bhate)</h2>
			<img src="images/Security.jpg" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="30" alt="Security" border="1">
			
			<p style="font-family:Times New Roman">Blockchain technology is currently one of the most popular technologies and has the potential to be used in every industry. It provides secure decentralized storage and is also referred to as a distributed ledger technology (DLT). Some blockchains, e.g. Ethereum, are known as next-generation blockchains because they incorporate smart contracts that automate the process of decentralized executions of programs.<br>Smart contracts are a key component of blockchains. These little slices of business logic are the self-executing code that enables developers to create the rules and processes that make up any blockchain-based application. However, while they have the potential to automate and simplify business processes, they are also the main target of any malicious actor looking to compromise such an application.</p>
			<pre style="font-family:Arial"> 1. Treat the underlying infrastructure of the blockchain solution as critical infrastructure.</pre>
			<pre style="font-family:Arial"> 2. Enforce access control in smart contracts.</pre>
			<pre style="font-family:Arial"> 3. Secure communications both internally and externally.</pre>
			<pre style="font-family:Arial"> 4. Enforce application security.</pre>
			<pre style="font-family:Arial"> 5. Enforce infrastructure security.</pre>
			<pre style="font-family:Arial"> 6. Perform full-scope penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.</pre>

			<h2>2. Will blockchain transform the stock market? (by Norbert Biedrzycki)</h2>

			<p style="font-family:Times New Roman">Blockchain can make it easier to transfer property rights and other assets by reducing transactional costs and boosting trust between investors. But can it be used by the world’s largest stock exchanges?<br><br>The rules that govern trades in financial assets have changed little over the past two or three centuries. Some say those rules have worked relatively well (apart from a few world-shattering crashes now and then). Does it need to change? Should it change? Can it change?<br><br>I believe it needs to, should, and can. What can we do to convince boards, investors, sellers, buyers, intermediaries and supervisory bodies to adopt new solutions? Assuming change is feasible, will blockchain be a major step toward doing away with traditional stock exchanges?<br><br>Financial institutions must, above all, be certain that their customers’ money is secure. It is therefore unsurprising that even given the examples related, capital markets are still slow to embrace blockchain. To see genuine progress, certain conditions must be met, primary among them the establishment of the most stringent security standards for the block system.</p>

			<h2>3. Why is blockchain booming in the Healthcare industries despite challenges? (by Vikash Das)</h2>
			<img src="images/article3.jpg" ALIGN="right" HSPACE="30" alt="Blockchain in Healthcare" border="1">
			<p style="font-family:Times New Roman">Blockchain technology is a P2P decentralized distributed public ledger that mitigates the dependence on a centralized authority while enabling secure and pseudo-anonymous transactions between the participating parties. Many aspects of Blockchain, such as decentralization, transparency, and immutability, are potentially drawing attention in the healthcare industry. Technology is addressing two of the most pressing issues that are: difficult access to health-related information by patients and incomplete records at the point of care. </p>
			<p style="font-family:Arial"> 1. Despite its popularity across multiple sectors, the perception that it only links best with Bitcoin has hindered its acceptance within the medical research communities. All entities involved in the healthcare department must accept and embrace this new model for its mass adoption. </p>
	<p style="font-family:Arial"> 2. The complexity of processing large amounts of data in a single transaction, such as an MRI image, a CAT scan, is the other significant issue that needs to be addressed. </p>
	<p style="font-family:Arial"> 3. Blockchain is incapable of removing deleted or replaced modified records. Instead, it adds additional blocks to represent such deletions and modifications, which indicates this process results in the need for ever-increasing storage. </p>
